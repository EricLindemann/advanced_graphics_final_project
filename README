CSCI 4239 Final Project City Scene

Based on Willem Schreuder's ex05 from Fall 2014
Willem A. (Vlakkies) Schreuder

with Frame Buffer Depth Texture by Jay Kominek

to run:
make
./ex05

things to add:
I am meeting with Stanislaw tomorrow to try to get shadows from multiple lights working. I intend to fix the small bugs (shadow showing on building). I plan to add a few more textures, more objects and normal maps (on lamp post, trash can, hydrant).
