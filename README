Eric Lindemann CSCI 4239 Final Project City Scene

Based on Willem Schreuder's ex05 from Fall 2014 but heavily edited (removed shadow maps)

Things to notice:
Normal Mapped most objects
Multiple shadows using real world technique (much faster than shadow mapping)
Shadows move with car, shadows dim as they get further from light source
Cool objects (car, bike, light post, hydrant, buildings with windows/door)

to run:
make
./final
